## Bayesian Ensembles of Exponentially Smoothed Life-Cycle Forecasts

This repository provides data and R scripts used in our paper "Bayesian Ensembles of Exponentially Smoothed Life-Cycle Forecasts". Below is the list and descriptions of the files.

### Study 1: Social Networks 


### Study 2: Computer Sales
#### Data files
\bold{dell_data_raw.csv} --- Standardized sales without end-of-life orders truncated (Acimovic et al. 2018). This data is used to simulate net cumulative sales (M).


#### Code files
S1 - SampleCumulativeSales-M.R --- Sample net cumulative sales. Method is provided in Section A.7 of the paper.
